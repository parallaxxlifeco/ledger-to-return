What was built, when, and what you'd need to know to change it. Newest first.

## 23 September 2026 — Personal / Business sorting

**The change.** Sorting no longer opens with 82 tracker lines. Each transaction
now asks one question first — **Personal**, **Business** or **Neither** — and the
dropdown that follows is only the list that answer needs.

| Answer | Dropdown | What it sets |
|---|---|---|
| Personal | the 18 personal lines from Budget Tracker (LIVING, SELF-CARE, LIFESTYLE, PERSONAL, MISC PAYMENTS) | sheet line; tax category is fixed at Personal spending and never reaches the return |
| Business | ATO categories, filtered to income or expense by which way the money went | tax category, then the sheet line — asked once per category, remembered after |
| Neither | transfers, drawings, tax and GST payments, loan principal | tax category only; feeds no sheet |

**Rules are now opt-in.** The *Make a rule* box on each card names the pattern it
will match and says how many loaded rows it will also answer. Ticked by default,
untick to answer just this one. Before, every choice silently became a rule.

**What a business answer learns.** Picking an ATO category for the first time
asks which line it lands on, and stores that in `S.lineFor`. From then on the
category fills the line by itself. Reopen a transaction and hit **Change** to
point a category at a different line.

**Keyboard.** `P` `B` `N` answer; type to narrow, `Enter` takes the top match,
`1`–`9` take one directly; `↑` `↓` move between rows; `R` toggles the rule box;
`Backspace` clears a row.

**Data model.** A tracking transaction now carries three fields instead of two:

```
kind  personal | business | exclude
line  sheet line key  (null on excluded rows)
tax   ATO category key (x_personal on personal rows)
```

Older rows carried `cat` (the sheet line) and `tax`, with the kind implied. They
migrate on load in `normTx` — the line decides, because a personal row carries an
"exclude" tax category and would otherwise be misread as a transfer. Saved rules
migrate the same way in `normRule`.

**Also.** Rate table refreshed to 14 September 2026. GIA Finance Tracking kept —
both sheets still fed.

**To change the sorting flow**, everything is in `part_c4.js` equivalent section
of `ledger-to-return.html`: `pickPool` decides what each answer offers,
`choose` applies it, `applyRule` carries it forward.

## 1 September 2026 — Hosted, with Drive

Moved off Claude to GitHub Pages, data saved to Google Drive. Storage became
pluggable so one source runs in both places — `artifactStore`, `driveStore`,
`localStore` behind one interface. `SETUP.md` records the GitHub and Google
Cloud configuration.

## 1 September 2026 — Tracking book

Added a second book alongside the tax return: transactions coded for the two
Google Sheets and for the return in one pass, with a monthly actuals grid per
sheet and per-block copy runs for pasting into the ACT columns.

## 1 September 2026 — First build

Import with column auto-detection, ECB daily rates to AUD at each transaction's
own date, keyboard categorising with merchant learning, and a report rolling up
to the ATO business schedule.
